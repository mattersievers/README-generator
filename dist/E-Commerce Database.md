  ## Description
  This application acts as a back-end to an e-commerce website. It uses Sequelize to connect to a SQL database to store and sort Category, Product, and Tag model information. The application establishes api routes to perform the CRUD operations also known as the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.

  ## Install
  Be sure to install the appropriate node modules with the command "npm install express sequelize mysql2 dotenv". Ensure there is an environment ".env" file created in the root directory with the variables DB_NAME = 'ecommerce_db', DB_USER = 'root'
  
  ## Use
  Use the command "node server" to initiate the server. The GET routes can be checked through either a browser or through an interface like Insomnia Core. The POST, PUT, and DELETE routes may also be tested through Insomnia Core.
